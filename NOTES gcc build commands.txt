# The prerequisites should already be in ~/workspace/gcc by using from ~/workspace/gcc
#./contrib/download_prerequisites
# Also ~/workspace/gcc-build-master dir was created
# Also flex is required for make sudo apt install flex
# Docu here https://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html

#TARGET for configure --host= is defaulting to the current machine, --target is defaulting to the host
#-v for verbose
#--prefix=dirname Specify the toplevel installation directory
#--program-suffix=12.2 could be used when checking out the 12.2 branch instead of master, but I build from master
#--disable-multilib to only build for current host (64-bit)

#no install used, as I didn't want to change the system, but instead just use a newer gcc to compile ~/workspace/kakoune

#g++: error: gengtype-lex.cc: No such file or directory
#Used apt-file find gengtype-lex.cc to find -> no output
#Solution: sudo apt install flex

#Then install to path specified in --prefix=/home/anton/workspace/gcc-build-master
# install-strip only copies binaries which don't contain the debug symbols
